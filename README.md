# Game On

Game On is a made up online game store. The idea for building this site is just an exercise to take a design comp and build out the UI, with a few tweaks on my part. It is not fully functional, but I added a few animations to the buttons. The site is responsive and works on all device sizes.

I did a random search for a design on the web. The comp can be found [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/88530265/game-store-concept).

Built with React (Vite), Typescript and CSS module.
